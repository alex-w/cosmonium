Cosmonium is a 3D astronomy and space exploration program. With Cosmonium you can navigate in our solar system and discover all the planets and their moons. You can also visit the neighboring stars and discover the true size of our galaxy and the Universe.

Cosmonium supports (or will support) the creation of fictional planets, stellar systems nebulaes, ... using procedural generation.

Cosmonium also already supports some Celestia addons (though CMOD and CelX are not yet supported).

### Requirements

Cosmonium runs on Windows (Vista or above), Linux (CentOS 5, Ubuntu 14 or above) or macOS (mac0S 10.9 or above)
with a graphic card supporting OpenGL 2.1 or better (OpenGL 4.5 is recommended) and at least 512MB of disk
(up to 4GB if the HD and UHD textures are installed).

### Installation 

Download the installer or package for your platform from the [download](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Download) page and see the [[Installation]] page
The package contains only low resolution textures, see [here](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Download#extra-textures) to install extra HD and UHD textures.

### Launch

Simply starts cosmonium from your application menu or from the cosmonium folder. See also the [installation](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Installation) page for more options.

### User interface

Cosmonium user interface is still heavily based on Celestia, most of the command and keyboard shortcuts work the same.
Go to [First steps](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/First-steps) to have an explanation of the basic command or see the [Control](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Control) page for an exhaustive list.

### Full documentation

Cosmonium is still in its infancy, but it is already usable to explore all the planets and the moons of our solar system, all the neighbor or visible stars and much more.
It also support custom content and addons, either as Cosmonium or Celestia addons.

The full documentation is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki)
